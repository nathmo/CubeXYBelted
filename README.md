# Assembly Guide

TODO ... 
(i use two custom tube for the belt that where laying around. you will need to make youre own using 20 mm alu tube and a few custom part (share the part if you do))

# Contributors
-> maybe you ?

-> me :3

-> every person on grabcad who made each subcompents model like the stepper, raspberry pi, relay, extrusion, etc
